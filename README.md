PROJECT TITLE
Submarine Navigation Risk Prediction: Classifying Ocean Obstacles as Rocks or Mines Using Machine Learning

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Submarine navigation in the ocean poses significant risks due to the presence of underwater obstacles such as rocks and mines. Accurate and timely detection of these obstacles is critical to ensuring the safety of submarines and preventing catastrophic incidents. Traditional detection methods may be slow, prone to errors, or require advanced sensor technology that is not always available in every scenario.

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict whether a submarine will encounter a rock or a mine based on a dataset of underwater obstacle characteristics. By developing a predictive model, this project seeks to enhance navigation systems, allowing submarines to take preventive actions and avoid potential hazards, thereby improving safety and operational efficiency in underwater environments.

DATASET INFORMATION
The dataset utilized for this project has been sourced from Kaggle, with full credit attributed to the original creator and the uploader. As the dataset lacks predefined headers or column names, the analysis will be conducted using the available raw data, requiring careful handling and preparation to address the problem statement.
